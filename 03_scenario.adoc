=== Installing Hal tool

Download and install the latest version of `hal` from https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/. `hal` is a developer-focused
tool aimed at helping you create microservices applications using Halkyon even easier, by guiding you in your choices as you
create components and link them together.

==== Binary installation for Mac OS

----
# curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/v0.1.8/hal_0.1.8_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----

==== Binary installation for Linux

----
# curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/v0.1.8/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
    -o /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz && \
    tar -xzf /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz && \
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----

**Remark**:

If the `/usr/local/bin` directory is owned by a `root` and your user doesn't have required permissions, then instead of the previous command, execute the following one:
----
sudo curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/v0.1.8/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -o /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz && \
  sudo tar -xzf /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.8_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -C /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----

==== Windows

Download and add it to your `PATH` environment variable:

. Download the `hal_0.1.8_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` file from the link:https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases[GitHub releases page].
. Extract the `hal.exec` file from the compressed archive.
. Add the location of the extracted binary to your `PATH` environment under by example `c:\tools`.

==== Docker

As alternative to using the native binaries for the various OSes, `Hal` commands can also be executed using `docker`.

NOTE: The `hal` image already packages the `oc` client version 4.x.

Execute this command to mount your current directory (where the execution of the lab's scenario will take place) within the container and pass various hal commands.

----
docker run --rm --name hal -v "/path/to/lab/dir:/home/lab" -it quay.io/halkyonio/hal:v0.1.8 <COMMAND>
----

=== Create a Git project

Create a `git repo` within the https://github.com/rhte-eu `org` for the EU Session Lab or https://github.com/rhte-us for the US Session Lab using your first and last name concatenated and cut after 8 chars as git hub repo name  (E.g : for the user Charles Moulliard, then the acronym to be used is `cmoullia`).

Execute the following command in a terminal
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halkyonio/rhte_lab_2019/master/scripts/git-create.sh)
----

Example of project created for `cmoullia`
----
bash <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halkyonio/rhte_lab_2019/master/scripts/git-create.sh)
Repo name (hit enter to use 'cmoullia')?
cmoullia
Creating Github repository 'cmoullia' under 'rhte-eu' ...
curl -u xxxxx:yyyyy https://api.github.com/orgs/rhte-eu/repos -d '{name:$repo_name, description:My cool $repo_name, private: false, has_issues: false, has_projects: true, has_wiki:false }'
done.
----

=== Log into the OpenShift cluster

`hal` needs an active connection to an OpenShift cluster so before performing any other operation users are requested to log into the RHTE OCP4 cluster using the `oc` client
and select or create their project.
----
oc login <SERVER_ADDRESS> -u user1 -p r3dh4t1!
----

**Important**: If docker is being used to execute hal commands, then the following command **must**, otherwise the kubernetes config file - `~/.kube/config` will not be created
and `hal` will report an error

----
docker run --rm --name hal -v "/path/to/lab/dir:/home/lab" -it quay.io/halkyonio/hal:v0.1.8 oc login <SERVER_ADDRESS> -u user1 -p r3dh4t1!
----

**Remarks**:
- The `<SERVER_ADDRESS>` corresponds to the OpenShift API Server address (e.g: `api.cluster-416e.416e.sandbox352.opentlc.com:6443`) as reported within the lab setup part.
- As every student has a dedicated OCP cluster, always connect using the user named `user1`

Grant the `admin` role to your `user1` user in order to gain access to the different projects, to list the resources created by Halkyon.
----
oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user admin user1 --as=system:admin
----

**Tip**: You can check if the operator is working properly  by executing this oc command: `oc describe -n operators pods -lname=halkyon-operator`

=== Create a new namespace

Create a new namespace
----
oc new-project rhtelab
----

=== Check the platform

While the environment has been installed for the lab and is running, it is nevertheless interesting to discover what we have installed, under which
namespace and their goal.

1. KubeDB

=== Scaffold the Spring Boot applications

Create a `rhtelab` development folder on your laptop
----
mkdir rhtelab && cd rhtelab

----

Use `hal` to create, in an interactive fashion, a new Spring Boot project using the REST HTTP `client` template proposed by the scaffolding tool.
So, execute the command `hal component spring-boot fruit-client-sb` by providing the following information to each question:

    Spring Boot version: `2.1.6.RELEASE`
    Supported version: `No`
    Create from template: `Yes`
    Available templates: `client`
    Group Id: `me.fruitstand`
    Artifact Id: `fruit-client-sb`
    Version: `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`
    Package name: `me.fruitstand.demo`

----
hal component spring-boot fruit-client-sb
? Spring Boot version 2.1.6.RELEASE
? Use 2.1.6.RELEASE supported version No
? Create from template Yes
? Available templates client
? Group Id me.fruitstand
? Artifact Id fruit-client-sb
? Version 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT
? Package name me.fruitstand.demo
----

Check that a project has been well created under the folder `fruit-client-sb`.

Repeat the operation to create a second Spring Boot project using the `crud` template. We'll do it in a non-interactive fashion this time.
`hal` is smart enough to check values you provided and only asks you to provide information when needed (e.g. if a provided value is incorrect):
----
hal component spring-boot \
   -i fruit-backend-sb \
   -g me.fruitstand \
   -p me.fruitstand.demo \
   -s 2.1.6.RELEASE \
   -t crud \
   -v 1.0.0-SNAPSHOT \
   --supported=false  \
  fruit-backend-sb
----

Create a `.gitignore` file to ignore the files added by your IDE and the build tool (maven in this case)
----
touch .gitignore
echo "*/target" >> .gitignore
echo ".idea/" >> .gitignore
----

**Remark**: The previous command added ignored for files added by IntelliJ. If a different IDE is being used, the command will be to updated.

The next step is to initialize a git repository, add the `pom.xml, .gitignore` files created earlier along with the two Spring Boot applications. Finally push to the  proper remote repository:
----
git init
git add .gitignore pom.xml fruit-backend-sb/ fruit-client-sb/
git commit -m "Initial project" -a
git remote add origin https://rhte-user:\!demo12345@github.com/<RHTE_ORG>/<YOUR_REPO_NAME>.git
git push -u origin master
----
**Note** that the user and password to push to the repo are `username="rhte-user"` and `password="!demo12345"`

=== Build the project

==== Client

Package your Spring Boot client application using the following maven commands:
----
mvn package -f fruit-client-sb
----

*Remark*: While this command isn't mandatory for the proper execution of the lab's scenario, it is nonetheless suggested in order to ensure that the Spring Boot project will correctly created.

==== Backend

Now, package the backend Spring Boot application, paying special attention to the `local` maven profile:
----
mvn package -f fruit-backend-sb -Plocal
----

**Remarks**:

- We need to use the `local` profile because the project is set up to work both locally using a `H2` database for quick testing and "remotely" using a `PostgreSQL` database.
  The `kubernetes` profile is enabled by default. This information is mirrored within the 2 Spring Boot application properties files under the folder `src/main/resources`.
  The `application.properties` file corresponds to the `local` profile while `application-kubernetes.properties` is used for `kubernetes` deployment.
  These 2 files contains the Spring Boot properties to configure the Datasource needed to access the database.
+
----
src/main/resources/application-kubernetes.properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://${DB_HOST}:${DB_PORT}/${DB_NAME}
spring.datasource.username=${DB_USER}
spring.datasource.password=${DB_PASSWORD}
spring.datasource.driver-class-name=org.postgresql.Driver
----
+
- Note also that this file contains a `Dekorate environment variable` definition called `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE` with a `kubernetes` value.
This is how Halkyon knows to activate the Spring `kubernetes` profile, i.e. make Spring Boot uses `application-kubernetes.properties` when
booting instead of the default `application.properties`.
+
----
src/main/resources/application-kubernetes.properties
...
dekorate.component.envs[0].name=SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE
dekorate.component.envs[0].value=kubernetes
----
+
- Finally, you can also see that the database connection parameters `${DB_xxxxx}` reference environment variables. These values will be injected
into your microservice application when you create a link between it and the appropriate database capability.

=== Create the Components

A component represents a microservice to be deployed. The Component Custom Resource provides the descriptor that allows Kubernetes/OpenShift
to deploy the microservice and, optionally, expose it outside of the cluster.

Creating and using a component is a two step process: first inform the operator about the component by "creating" it, then make
its associated application available to the cluster to be able to run it by "pushing" it to the cluster.

First check if you are using your project:
----
oc project
Using project "rhtelab" on server "https://api.cluster-416e.416e.sandbox352.opentlc.com:6443".
----

Next create the different microservices as `components` using the `hal component create` command.
During this process, the tool will create a `Component` custom resource using the Java Dekorate Library which will be handled by the halkyon operator to create all the Kubernetes resources
needed to deploy your application properly. You only need to worry about your component metadata instead of wondering how it
needs to be materialized in the cluster using Deployments, Services, etc…
----
hal component create -c fruit-client-sb
'fruit-client-sb' component was not found, initializing it
 ✓  Waiting for component fruit-client-sb to be ready…
 ✓  Successfully created 'fruit-client-sb' component
hal component create -c fruit-backend-sb
'fruit-backend-sb' component was not found, initializing it
 ✓  Waiting for component fruit-backend-sb to be ready…
 ✓  Successfully created 'fruit-backend-sb' component
----

**Note**:

You can discover the file populated by Dekorate by opening the following folder `{fruit-client-sb,fruit-backend-sb}/target/classes/META-INF/dekorate/`

----
Example of halkyon.yml file
---
apiVersion: "v1"
kind: "List"
items:
- apiVersion: "halkyon.io/v1beta1"
  kind: "Component"
  metadata:
    labels:
      app: "fruit-backend-sb"
    name: "fruit-backend-sb"
  spec:
    deploymentMode: "dev"
    runtime: "spring-boot"
    version: "2.1.6.RELEASE"
    exposeService: true
    envs:
    - name: "SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE"
      value: "kubernetes"
    buildConfig:
      type: "s2i"
      url: "https://github.com/rhte-eu/cmoullia1.git"
      ref: "master"
      contextPath: ""
      moduleDirName: "fruit-backend-sb"
    port: 8080
----

IMPORTANT: Take the time to discuss with the instructor the content of this file ;-)

Check if the components have been correctly installed within another terminal
----
oc get cp
NAME               RUNTIME       VERSION         AGE       MODE      STATUS    MESSAGE                                                                    REVISION
fruit-backend-sb   spring-boot   2.1.6.RELEASE   11s       dev       Pending   pod is not ready for Component 'fruit-backend-sb' in namespace 'rhtelab'
fruit-client-sb    spring-boot   2.1.6.RELEASE   103s      dev       Ready     Ready
----

NOTE: if you try to access the associated services, they won't work because the components haven't been wired together yet. Hence the need for the following steps! :smile:

=== Create a PostgreSQL DB

By creating a capability, we will then inform the Operator that the corresponding service needs to be installed. For the purpose of this lab, we will create a database capability. More specifically we will create a PostgreSQL database.

So, create a capability using the interactive mode of the `hal` tool and this command `hal capability create`:

Select as :

    Category: `database`
    Type: `postgres`
    version : `10`
    Default-name: `postgres-db`

For the parameters which are needed to configure not only the database's instance but also the parameters of the Java Datasource
used by the Spring JPA component, use the following key-value pairs:

    DB_NAME: `sample-db`
    DB_PASSWORD: `admin`
    DB_USER: `admin`

The output of the execution of the command should be similar to what it is is displayed here after:
----
hal capability create
? Category database
? Type postgres
? Version 10
? Change default name (postgres-db)
? Enter a value for string property DB_NAME: sample-db
? Enter a value for string property DB_PASSWORD: admin
? Enter a value for string property DB_USER: admin
 ✓  Created capability postgres-db
----

Check the capability status:
----
oc get capabilities
NAME                                      CATEGORY   KIND      AGE       STATUS    MESSAGE                                                                                                      REVISION
postgres-capability-1568134805423273000   Database             25s       Pending   postgreSQL db is not ready for Capability 'postgres-capability-1568134805423273000' in namespace 'rhtelab'
----

If the status is not ready, wait a few moments for the `KubeDB` operator to create the database within your namespace and repeat the command again
----
oc get capability
NAME          CATEGORY   KIND      AGE       STATUS    MESSAGE   REVISION
postgres-db   Database             4m        Ready     Ready
----

TIP: You can for all the resources created check the content generated using the oc command : `oc get component postgres-db -o yaml`, ...

=== Link the microservices

Creating the `components` and the `capability` is not enough as we must pass different information to the `components` in order to let them
to know how to access the endpoint of the REST service exposed by the `fruit-backend` for example or to fill the parameters of the datasource to access the database.

This is what we will perform within this section of the lab using the `hal link create` command where we will inject (or bind/wire) the information
within the component deployed

To wire the `fruit-backend-sb` component with the `postgres-db` capability, we will then create a link.
Execute `hal link create` to use the interactive mode and next select the following information.

    Target: `component: fruit-backend-sb`
    Use secret: `Y`
    Secret (only potential matches shown) : `postgres-db-config`
    Change default name (fruit-backend-sb-link-1568907618694167000): `fruit-backend-sb-link`

The resulting outcome of the execution of the command is :
----
hal link create
? Target component: fruit-backend-sb
? Use Secret Yes
Selected link type: Secret
? Secret (only potential matches shown) postgres-db-config
? Change default name fruit-backend-sb-link
 ✓  Created link fruit-backend-sb-link
----

**REMARK**: The parameters `DB_xxxx` defined within the secret will be then used to create the corresponding ENV variables mounted to the Spring Boot application when it will start.

**IMPORTANT**: The current releases of  `Hal` and `Halkyon` operator used for this lab rely on the assumption that you know the type of the information to be injected (e.g : secret, env variable, ...).
While this approach is perfectly fine for a lab, that should be definitively improved and that will become part of future iterations of the `halkyon` technology using a contract definition.

To configure the Rest Client of the Spring Boot `fruit-client-sb`, we have defined a variable called `${KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_FRUIT}` within the `application.properties` file

----
endpoint.fruit=${KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_FRUIT}
----

as a value provider for the `endpoint.fruit` java property.

----
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class ClientController {

    @Value("${endpoint.fruit:}")
    private String endPoint;
----

This is the property the Spring Boot application relies on to connect to the backend HTTP endpoint or Backend Service.

Create a link targeting the `fruit-client-sb` component using again the command `hal link create` to let `fruit-client-sb` know about the backend.

    Target: `component: fruit-client-sb`
    Use Secret: `No`
    Env variable in the 'name=value': `KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_FRUIT=http://fruit-backend-sb:8080/api/fruits`
    Change default name: `fruit-client-sb-link`

**REMARK**: Like for the secret, the `ENV VARIABLE` defined will be used also to configure the pod of the Spring Boot Application when it will start !

The resulting outcome of the execution of the command is :
----
hal link create
? Target component: fruit-client-sb
? Use Secret No
Selected link type: Env
? Env variable in the 'name=value' format, press enter when done KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_FRUIT=http://fruit-backend-sb:8080/api/fruits
Set env variable: KUBERNETES_ENDPOINT_FRUIT=http://fruit-backend-sb:8080/api/fruits
? Env variable in the 'name=value' format, press enter when done
? Change default name fruit-client-sb-link
 ✓  Created link fruit-client-sb-link
----

Check the link status:
----
oc get links
NAME                    AGE       STATUS    MESSAGE
fruit-backend-sb-link   4m        Ready     Ready
fruit-client-sb-link    2m        Ready     Ready
----

=== Push the code

Now that we have created the different entities necessary for implementing a sample microservices architecture, as well as their relations and backend service, we will push the code (to compile it on the platform) and to verify if we can access the HTTP endpoints
exposed as route.

----
hal component push -c fruit-client-sb
 ✓  Uploading /Users/dabou/Temp/rhtelab/fruit-client-sb.tar
hal component push -c fruit-backend-sb
 ✓  Uploading /Users/dabou/Temp/rhtelab/fruit-backend-sb.tar
----

NOTE: if you try to `push` the component again without changing anything locally, `hal` is smart enough to detect it and not do anything as nothing is required in this case. Give it a try, then change the code for one of the app and attempt to push again to see what happens!

=== Connect to the Client or Backend services

Try the backend service to see if it works
So, get the route address of the backend microservice using this command `oc get routes/fruit-backend-sb --template={{.spec.host}}`
Copy/paste the address in a browser. You should see a simple web page allowing you to see fruits and create new ones.

Try the client microservice to see if it works too.
So, get also its route address using this command `oc get routes/fruit-client-sb --template={{.spec.host}}`
and curl the service within your terminal, you should get the fruits created in the previous step.
----
FRONTEND_URL=<host-of-client-route>
curl "http://${FRONTEND_URL}/api/client"
[{"id":4,"name":"orange"},{"id":5,"name":"apple"},{"id":6,"name":"strawberry"}]
----

=== Switch to build mode

When we have finished to test/push the project on the cloud machine, then we can start the process to build a docker image. In
Halkyon parlance, we need to change the deployment mode of the component to the `build` mode. Changing the deployment mode will
let Halkyon know that it needs to trigger an image build instead of relying on the supervisor-based approach provided by the
default `dev` mode. This, in turns, uses Tekton to accomplish the required steps.

Once again, `hal` makes this process painless as this can be accomplished using the `hal component switch` command:
----
hal component switch -m build -c fruit-client-sb
INFO[0000] Component fruit-client-sb switched to build
hal component switch -m build -c fruit-backend-sb
INFO[0000] Component fruit-backend-sb switched to build
----

Test the service again
----
open "http://$(oc get routes/fruit-backend-sb --template={{.spec.host}})"
FRONTEND_URL=$(oc get routes/fruit-client-sb --template={{.spec.host}})
curl "http://${FRONTEND_URL}/api/client"
----

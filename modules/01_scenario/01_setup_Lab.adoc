= Lab Setup

.Prerequisites
.. The `ssh` utility installed on your laptop.
+
NOTE: If your network connection is intermittent, consider installing the https://mosh.org/[mosh] utility (`yum install mosh`) as an alternative to the `ssh` utility.

.. Web browser installed on your laptop.
.. Broadband internet connectivity.

== Overview
The project to be developed will contain 2 Spring Boot applications where one is a client
consuming the service exposed by a backend application connected to a PostgreSQL database.

The client will be called `fruit-client-sb` and the backend `fruit-backend-sb` as depicted here after.

- [blue]#Blue:# Spring Boot microservice (aka component)
- [yellow]#Yellow:# Link used to inject METADATA
- [green]#Green:# A capability such as a database

== Course Lab Environment

Your lab environment is remote and can be accessed via ssh as well as through your local browser.

=== Order Lab Environment
This section guides you through the procedure to order a virtual machine (VM) for this course.

include::{lab_order_type}.adoc[]

=== Command Line Utilities
Your lab environment comes pre-installed with the following utilities:

. *java* (version 1.8.0)
. *javac* (version 1.8.0)
. *maven* (version 3.5.4)
. *git*
. *jq*
. *podman*
. *buildah*
. *oc* (version: 3.11.82;   This corresponds to the version of OpenShift running in your lab environment).
. *hal*
+
This is a new command line utility that assists in scaffolding of microservice applications running in OpenShift, link them or to create a service such as a Database.
+
More information about this utility is found throughout the remainder of this lab.

==== Refresh _hal_ utility for Linux

To ensure that your lab environment uses the latest tag of the _hal_ utility, execute the following command in the terminal of you remote lab environment
to fetch the latest released version:
----
hal_version=$(curl --silent "https://api.github.com/repos/halkyonio/hal/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"([^"]+)".*/\1/')
----

. Download and install latest tag of _hal_:
+
----
sudo curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/${hal_version}/hal_${hal_version:1}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -o /usr/local/bin/hal_${hal_version:1}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz && \
  sudo tar -xzf /usr/local/bin/hal_${hal_version:1}_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -C /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----

. Verify the version:
+
-----
hal version

hal 0.1.12 built with ❤️ by the Halkyon team on '2019-10-11T12:42:13Z' (commit: 1a6c948) running on top of 'oc'
-----

== OpenShift Container Platform

Your lab environment includes Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

Access to your OCP resources can be gained via both the `oc` CLI utility and the OCP web console.

=== OpenShift Namespaces

. In the terminal of your remote lab environment, authenticate into OpenShift as a non cluster admin user (user1) using the `oc` utility
+
-----
oc login https://master00.example.com -u user1 -p r3dh4t1!
-----

. View existing projects:
+
-----
$ oc get projects --as=system:admin

...

kubedb                             Active

...

operators                          Active
tekton-pipelines                   Active
-----

.. *kubedb*
+
This OCP project contains an operator that manages the lifecycle of the databases in OpenShift.

.. *operators*
+
This OCP project contains the _halkyon_ operator.

.. *tekton-pipelines*
+
This OCP project contains operators that provide CI/CD infrastructure to build your SpringBoot applications using by example a S2i build task.

=== OpenShift Web Console

. Set an environment variable called: `OCP_REGION` :
+
-----
echo "export OCP_REGION=`echo $HOSTNAME | cut -d'.' -f1 | cut -d'-' -f2`" >> $HOME/.bashrc

source $HOME/.bashrc
-----
REMARK: This command should be executed within the ssh vm !

. Point your browser to the URL created by executing the following :
+
-----
$ echo -en "\nhttps://master00-$OCP_REGION.generic.opentlc.com\n\n"
-----

. Authenticate using the following user credentials
.. Username:    user1
.. Password:    r3dh4t1!

=== Refresh OpenShift components

From time to time, some components in your OpenShift based lab environment tend not to start-up cleanly.
So as to ensure all components work as expected, execute the following in your remote lab environment:

-----
# Switch to root operating system user
sudo -i


mkdir -p $HOME/lab && \
  wget \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/halkyonio/rhte_lab_2019/master/scripts/lab_state_refresh.sh \
  -O $HOME/lab/lab_state_refresh.sh \
  && chmod 755 $HOME/lab/lab_state_refresh.sh \
  && $HOME/lab/lab_state_refresh.sh


# Exit back to non-root operating system user
exit
-----

== Operators

Your lab environment comes pre-installed with various OpenShift operators.

In this section of the lab, you review these operators.

. *KubeDB*
+
This operator is responsible for the lifecycle of the PostgreSQL database that will be used in your application.
In particular, the operator will create the database and configure its parameters.
+
The source code for this operator can be found link:http://kubedb.com[here].
+
You can view the log file of the operator as follows:
+
----

oc logs `oc get pod -lapp=kubedb -n kubedb --as=system:admin -o name` -n kubedb --as=system:admin

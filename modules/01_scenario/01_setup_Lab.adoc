= Lab Setup

.Prerequisites
.. The `ssh` utility installed on your laptop.
+
NOTE: If your network connection is intermittent, consider installing the https://mosh.org/[mosh] utility (`yum install mosh`) as an alternative to the `ssh` utility.

.. Web browser installed on your laptop.
.. Broadband internet connectivity.

== Overview
The project to be developed will contain 2 Spring Boot applications where one is a client
consuming the service exposed by a backend application connected to a PostgreSQL database.

The client will be called `fruit-client-sb` and the backend `fruit-backend-sb` as depicted here after.

== Course Lab Environment

Your lab environment is remote and can be accessed via ssh as well as through your local browser.

=== Order Lab Environment
This section guides you through the procedure to order a virtual machine (VM) for this course.

include::{lab_order_type}.adoc[]

=== Command Line Utilities
Your lab environment commes pre-installed with the following utilities:

. *java* (version 1.8.0)
. *javac* (version 1.8.0)
. *maven* (version 3.5.4)
. *git*
. *podman*
. *buildah*
. *oc* (version: 3.11.82;   This corresponds to the version of OpenShift running in your lab environment).
. *hal*
+
This is a new command line utility that assists in scaffolding of microservice applications runnining in OpenShift.
More information about this utility is found throughout the remainder of this lab.

==== Refresh _hal_ utility for Linux

To ensure that your lab environment uses the latest tag of the _hal_ utility, execute the following in the terminal of you remote lab environment:

. Download and install latest tag of _hal_:
+
----
sudo curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/v0.1.10/hal_0.1.10_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -o /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.10_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz && \
  sudo tar -xzf /usr/local/bin/hal_0.1.10_Linux_x86_64.tar.gz \
  -C /usr/local/bin && sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----


. Verify the version:
+
-----
hal version


hal 0.1.10 built with ❤️ by the Halkyon team on '2019-10-01T18:25:46Z' (commit: 3c9f118) running on top of 'oc'
-----


== OpenShift Container Platform

Your lab environment includes Red Hat's OpenShift Container Platform (OCP).

Access to your OCP resources can be gained via both the `oc` CLI utility and the OCP web console.

=== OpenShift Namespaces

. In the terminal of your remote lab environment, authenticate into OpenShift as a non cluster admin user (user1) using the `oc` utility
+
-----
oc login https://master00.example.com -u user1 -p r3dh4t1!
-----

. Set an environment variable called: `OCP_REGION` :
+
-----
echo "export OCP_REGION=`echo $HOSTNAME | cut -d'.' -f1 | cut -d'-' -f2`" >> $HOME/.bashrc

source $HOME/.bashrc
-----

Your lab environment is now ready to use.  Please proceed to the link:TODO[next lab].

== Appendix


=== Optional: OCP cluster admin related tasks

. OCP cluster admin access is provided by switching to the root operating system of your lab environment as follows.
+
-----
$ sudo -i
-----

. Provider the OCP user called _user1_ with the ability to impersonate cluster admin:
+
-----
# oc adm policy add-cluster-role-to-user sudoer user1
-----

. Validate the ability to _impersonate_ cluster admin:
+
-----
$ oc get nodes --as=system:admin

=== Optional: Provision Lab environment in your own openshift

It is offered to those that are interested in provisioning an environment to support this lab using their own resources.

The lab environment assumes an existing OCP 3.11 installation with cluster admin access and about 24GB of RAM.

The lab environment can be provisioned via the following Ansible:

TO_DO

=== Optional:  Install _hal_ utility on other operating systems

`hal` is a developer-focused tool whose purpose is to make the development of microservice applications using Halkyon even easier.
It does so by guiding the developer in choices as they create microservice components and link them together.

The _hal_ utility is already installed in your lab environment.

The following is provided if you desire the _hal_ utility installed in a different operating system.

===== Binary installation for Mac OS

----
# curl -L https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases/download/v0.1.9/hal_0.1.9_Darwin_x86_64.tar.gz | tar -xz -C /usr/local/bin/ && chmod +x /usr/local/bin/hal
----


===== Windows

Download and add it to your `PATH` environment variable:

. Download the `hal_0.1.9_Windows_x86_64.tar.gz` file from the link:https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/releases[GitHub releases page].
. Extract the `hal.exec` file from the compressed archive.
. Add the location of the extracted binary to your `PATH` environment under by example `c:\tools`.

===== Docker

As alternative to using the native binaries for the various OSes, `Hal` commands can also be executed using `docker`.

NOTE: The `hal` image already packages the `oc` client version 4.x.

Execute this command to mount your current directory (where the execution of the lab's scenario will take place) within the container and pass various hal commands.

----
docker run --rm --name hal -v "/path/to/lab/dir:/home/lab" -it quay.io/halkyonio/hal:v0.1.9 <COMMAND>
----


ifdef::showscript[]


Grant the `admin` role to your `user1` user in order to gain access to the different projects, to list the resources created by Halkyon.

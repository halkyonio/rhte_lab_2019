Long Description: 

== Hal Client and Halkyon Operator Workshop

This workshop aims to discover how you can simplify the development of your applications (aka microservices) on Kubernetes/OpenShift
using the `https://github.com/halkyonio/hal/[Hal Cloud Client Tool]` and `https://github.com/halkyonio/operator/[Halkyon Operator]`.

== Goals

In this workshop, you will :

- Learn how the deployment of microservices could be simplified on k8s/OpenShift by:
  - Adopting the `Dekorate` Tool responsible to generate the kubernetes manifests (aka yaml/json resources)
  - Delegating to an Operator the responsibility to manage complex tasks to compose the microservices
- Play with a `Developer` tool called `Hal` to communicate with the cluster and perform the following tasks:
  -- Compose & link microservices
  -- Create and install a `capability` such as a database and link it to to microservice consuming it
- Code locally and next `push/build` on k8s/OpenShift

Long Description: 

== Hal Client and Halkyon Operator Workshop
Simplify the development of Spring Boot applications/microservices using Hal Cloud Client Tool and Halkyon Operator on Kubernetes

== Goals

In this lab, you will :

- Learn how the deployment of microservices could be simplified on k8s/OpenShift by adopting our `Dekorate` Tool and by delegating to an Operator the responsibility to deal with kubernetes/manifests creation
- Play with a `Developer` tool called `Hal` to communicate with the cluster
- Compose & link microservices
- Deploy a `capability` such as a database and link it to to microservice consuming it
- Code locally and next `push/build` on k8s/OpenShift
